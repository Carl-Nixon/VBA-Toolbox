# VBA-Toolbox
This will be a collection of handy VBA functions that can be used in Excel projects.
The plan is to have separate .bas files for file handling, formatting, ETL and so on. There will be a separate README file to accompany each .bas listing what each function is, what it does and any arguments it needs.
If you would like to see a particular tool created and added here, please let me know at carlnixonsemail@gmail.com.
